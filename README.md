# BanklessBot

Bankless Discord Bot development

## What We Need

Devs, testers, reviewers. If you are interested in developing features for
the bot, please see the Getting Started heading below. If you want to be
involved as a tester, please connect with a developer; paired programming
will be a big win here. If you are interested in helping as a reviewer,
please connect with any package maintainer for details on workflow.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in helping with development, follow the steps outlined under docs/
in [CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md). This consists of setting up your own bot, having it added
to the test server, and acquiring the tokens to connect with the test Notion
and database.
