		'🔴 Education: We learn from each other. We seek to become a trusted guide that empowers people all over the globe to adopt decentralized finance by sharing accurate, truthful, and objective information.\n' +
		'🔴 Integrity: We operate transparently and build trust through radically public discourse and financial auditability.\n' +
		'🔴 Decentralized Governance: We put decision making into the hands of the collective. We create legitimacy through an environment where the best ideas win.\n' +
		'🔴 Culture: We reward action and embrace risk. We empower our community to continually drive new initiatives by providing a space to self-organize and quickly move from idea to action.\n' +
